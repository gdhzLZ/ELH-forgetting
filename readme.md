# ELH-forgetting
* The file /src/forgetting/forgetter.java is about how to forget roles and concepts from an ontology, and a corresponding example is shown in its main method.
* The file /src/forgetting/LDiff.java is about how to compute logical difference between two ontologies based on forgetting, and a corresponding example is shown in its main method.
* The method "isEntailed" of ELK reasoner may can not entail objectpropertyof type.But we can get it in another way. So we futher package the "isEntailed" method. It is in /src/elk/elkEntailment.java.
* You can get an easy usage of the systems at http://www.forgettingshow.info/index . But now this GUI can not save the forgetting results to your local disk. Maybe I'll Implemented it in a few days.
